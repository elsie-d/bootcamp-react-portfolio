          <Col >My name is Elsie (pronounced "L.C." 😉), and I am a recent Full-Stack Developer bootcamp graduate from the edEx UC Davis program. For the past few months I've had very little free time to enjoy hobbies such as hiking, dancing, and cooking but it's ok because my time at the bootcamp has been worth the learning experice! I came in to the course with basic understanding of HTML and CSS and finished up with a vast knowledgebase that covers the client, server, and database. Technologies I learned include JavaScript, Node, SQL, MongoDB, and React, my personal favorite being JavaScript.  </Col>
