For the past few months I've had very little free time to enjoy hobbies such as hiking, dancing, and cooking but it's ok because my time at the bootcamp has been worth the learning experice! I came in to the course with basic understanding of HTML and CSS and am about to finish it up with a vast knowledgebase that covers the client, server, and database.   </Col>
